# Flower_classification

A new deep convolutional neural network with multiple hidden layers is proposed for the identification of flowers. The convolution recognition model is constructed by analyzing the deep neural network architecture, convolution and pooling methods and back propagation errors proposed in this paper. By training FLOWERS17 and FLOWERS102 dataset using CNNs and comparing results with traditional neural network and support vector machine in the experiment, it shows that the proposed algorithm can improve the recognition accuracy of flower recognition by more than 10%.
